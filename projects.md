Research projects at the Sikuli Lab.

## Visual Automation

### Sikuli Java API

Sikuli API for Java provides image-based GUI automation functionalities to Java programmers. This API is a response to the desire of many Sikuli users to use Sikuli Script's functionalities directly in their Java programs, rather than writing Jython scripts. This new Java library has a re-designed API and includes several new functions that were not available in the original Sikuli Script, such as the abilities to match colors, handle events, and find geometric patterns such as rectangular buttons.

### Sikuli Slides

Sikuli Slides turns presentation slides into executable programs for automating graphical user interfaces (GUI). A typical Sikuli Slide contains a screenshot and a set of annotations. The screenshot can be of any part of a user interface, such as a button, a group of buttons, a form, a dialog box, a window, or the entire desktop. The annotations are boxes to indicate targets and text boxes to indicate actions to be performed on the targets.

### Sikuli Script

Sikuli Script lets users write simple image-based scripts to automate any graphical user interface on the screen. A statement in Sikuli Script consists of a simple command such as click or type and a screenshot of the GUI widget the command should be applied on.

### UI Computation

User Interface Computation (UIC) is a new contextualized method for teaching CS1. UIC uses the Sikuli API to allow students to create visual programs in Python or Java to interact with common graphical user interfaces (GUI) familiar to the students, such as posting on Facebook or sending Twitter messages.

## Visual Accessibility

### Tactile Picture Books

![tactile book](/images/banner_tactile_picture_books.png)

Tactile picture books are great for reading with young children. But they are hard and time consuming to make. We believe 3D printing holds the key to simplifying the making of tactile picture books. As 3D printers become cheaper and more powerful, soon it will become a reality that people own and use 3D printers at home, just like how people own and use color printers at home today.
