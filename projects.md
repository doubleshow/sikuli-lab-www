Research projects at the Sikuli Lab.

## Visual Automation

### Sikuli Slides

![sikuli slides](/images/banner_sikuli_slides.png)

Sikuli Slides turns presentation slides into executable programs for automating graphical user interfaces (GUI). A typical Sikuli Slide contains a screenshot and a set of annotations. The screenshot can be of any part of a user interface, such as a button, a group of buttons, a form, a dialog box, a window, or the entire desktop. The annotations are boxes to indicate targets and text boxes to indicate actions to be performed on the targets.

### UI Computation

User Interface Computation (UIC) is a new contextualized method for teaching CS1. UIC uses the Sikuli API to allow students to create visual programs in Python or Java to interact with common graphical user 
interfaces (GUI) familiar to the students, such as posting on Facebook or sending Twitter messages.


### Sikuli Script

![sikuli scripts](/images/banner_sikuli_script.png)

Sikuli Script lets users write simple image-based scripts to automate any graphical user interface on the screen. A statement in Sikuli Script consists of a simple command such as click or type and a screenshot of the GUI widget the command should be applied on.

### Sikuli Java API

Sikuli API for Java provides image-based GUI automation functionalities to Java programmers. This API is a response to the desire of many Sikuli users to use Sikuli Script's functionalities directly in their Java programs, rather than writing Jython scripts. This new Java library has a re-designed API and includes several new functions that were not available in the original Sikuli Script, such as the abilities to match colors, handle events, and find geometric patterns such as rectangular buttons.

## Visual Accessibility

### Tactile Picture Books

![tactile book](/images/banner_tactile_picture_books.png)

Tactile picture books are great for reading with young children. But they are hard and time consuming to make. We believe 3D printing holds the key to simplifying the making of tactile picture books. As 3D printers become cheaper and more powerful, soon it will become a reality that people own and use 3D printers at home, just like how people own and use color printers at home today.


## Visual Security

### Screen Fingerprint
Screen Fingerprint is a novel way of validating the identity of the person at a console. This new cyberbiometric can help measure and analyze active authentication. A screen fingerprint is acquired taking a screen recording of the computer being used by an individual and extracting discriminative visual features from the recording, features that are unique to that individual.

### Visual Fingerprint

![visual fingerprint](/images/banner_visual_fingerprint.png)

Visual fingerprint is a new modality our team proposes to measure and analyze for active authentication on mobile devices. The visual fingerprint of an operator consists of three visual streams acquired by the front camera, the back camera, and the screen recorder respectively.

### Android UI Verification

Logical inconsistency between the UI and the underlying program behaviors can be an indicator for security risk. We aim to identify a set of novel safety properties to capture whether a particular sensor, input, or network operation is logically consistent with what users may see and understand through the GUI. As an example, a “Cancel” button that turns on a camera is illogical. It may be a bug introduced by the app developers unintentionally. It may be a malicious function planted by an attacker intentionally. Either way it is desirable to automatically these logic-defying program patterns and report them as security threats.

## Visual Design

### NatureNet:Crowd-sourcing Design for Citizen Science

![naturenet](/images/banner_naturenet.png)

NatureNet is an interactive platform that encourages visitors to a nature preserve to become citizen scientists. This is accomplished through involving park visitors not only to share their photos, data, and observations but also contribute ideas to improve the NatureNet platform.

### VizWeb: Visual Preferences Analysis

![vizweb](/images/banner_vizweb.png)

Users make lasting judgments about a website's appeal within a split second of seeing it for the first time. And this first impression is influential enough to later affect their opinion of a site's usability and trustworthiness. Our aim is to automatically adapt website aesthetics to users' various preferences in order to improve this first impression. As a first step, we have been working on predicting what people find appealing, and how this is influenced by their demographic backgrounds.
